=========================

\*\*\*\* guide will guide you through the \*\*\*\*\*\*\* of downloading
and installing Java on Windows.

**PLEASE NOTE!** Java ([not to be confused with
JavaScript](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/learn/misc/difference-between-java-javascript?utm_source=whatismybrowsercom&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=install-java&utm_content=install-java-main-page)!)
is very old technology.

You \*\* \*\*\* require Java installed to use the modern internet.
However some *very* old websites may still require it to use \*\*\*\*
kind of out-dated system, but generally speaking Java is \*\*\*\* and
gone.

Additionally, Java is notorious \*\*\* having security problems and
bugs, so if you do install it, make sure \*\*\* keep it up to date.

**Only install Java if you are certain you require it!**.

If a website has warned you that you don't \*\*\*\* JavaScript enabled
and you've found this page to fix \*\*\* problem; \*\*\* chances \*\*\*
you're actually looking for our [guides to enable
JavaScript](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-javascript/?utm_source=whatismybrowsercom&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=install-java)
instead.

1.  Visit the Java website and download the installer {style="box-sizing: inherit; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; font-size: 20px;"}
    -------------------------------------------------

    To install Java, you first need to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* the installer
    program from Oracle.

    \*\*\*\*\* the "Download Java"
    page: [https://java.com/download](https://java.com/download)

    Click the "**Free Java Download**" button.

    ![The Java download
    page](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932090.png)

    You are \*\*\*\* prompted to read and agree with the end user
    license agreement.

    ![The end user license agreement
    page](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932119.png)

    Depending \*\* which web browser \*\*\* are using to download Java
    and depending on \*\*\* configuration, \*\*\* may be
    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\* either Download, Save or Run \*\*\*
    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* file.

    ![Internet Explorer is prompting you to Run or Save the
    installer](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229931923.png)

    If you \*\*\* prompted to run the Java \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*
    from Oracle, it is ok to just click the Run button. You also may
    prefer to save it to your disk and then manually find and \*\*\* the
    installer yourself.

2.  Run \*\*\* installer {style="box-sizing: inherit; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; font-size: 20px;"}
    --------------------

    Depending on your Windows Security Settings, you \*\*\* be prompted
    to allow the \*\*\*\* Installer to modify files on your computer.
    This is an important safeguard to make \*\*\*\* you really want to
    let software you've downloaded from the internet make changes to
    your computer. Please make sure this is the correct installer file
    and then when you're satisfied \*\*\*\* it is, click the "Yes"
    button.

    installer](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img1612299321.png)

3.  Install Java {style="box-sizing: inherit; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; font-size: 20px;"}
    ------------

    You are now shown the Java installer program.

    \*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* change the Java install
    destination folder (using the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\* the bottom
    left), however this is an advanced \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* should only
    be used by users who have a specific need to configure Java. It is
    fine to ignore this option.

    When you have read and are ready to accept the license agreement,
    click the "**Install**" button.

    program](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932025.png)

    Java will \*\*\* download and install itself.

    ![Java installing
    itself](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img1612299320.png)

    Congratulations, you have now installed Java.

    ![Click the 'Close' button and Java will reopen your web browser to
    verify
    itself](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932098.png)

4.  Verify Java {style="box-sizing: inherit; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; font-size: 20px;"}
    -----------

    The Java installer will open your default web browser and prompt you
    to verify your Java installation.

    ### Chrome doesn't support Java \*\*\* more {style="box-sizing: inherit;"}

    Google Chrome no longer supports Java on websites. Fewer sites use
    Java these days and \*\*\* NPAPI system that Java uses has often
    caused security risks on websites. You \*\*\* read more \*\*\*\*\*
    it in the official statements from Google and Oracle:

    \

    -   [Google's announcement regarding Java \*\*\* NPAPI
        plugins](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033)
    -   [](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033)
    -   [](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033)[Java \*\*\*
        Google Chrome
        Browser](https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml)

5.  \

    If you try to \*\*\* Chrome to verify your Java installation, you
    will get an error:

    ![The error message you get when you try to run Java applications in
    Chrome.](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img1612299319.png)

    You need to \*\*\* a different browser (such as \*\*\*\*\*\* or
    Firefox) which still supports Java.

    Typically, \*\*\* will be prompted to allow the Java plugin to run.
    The following \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is taken from \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    Explorer.

    1.  First, verify that \*\* is the offical Java plugin which is
        \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* to run. At the time of
        the production of \*\*\*\* guide, the plugin name is **Java(tm)
        Plug-\*\* SSV Helper** and it is published by **Oracle America,
        Inc.**
    2.  When \*\*\* are \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* it is the correct plugin,
        click the **Enable** button.
    3.  Then click \*\*\* red **\*\*\*\*\*\* Java version** button on
        the \*\*\*\* website.

6.  ![How to verify Java using the Oracle
    application](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932114.png)

    You are \*\*\*\* prompted one more time by Java itself if you want
    \*\* run this application. Pay attention to the warning \*\* gives
    \*\*\*\*\* granting unrestricted \*\*\*\*\*\* to your computer. You
    should always be very careful \*\*\*\* you run Java applications;
    make sure you only run applications from companies you trust.

    In particular, always look at the **Publisher** name.

    In this instance, we are talking about a Java application made by
    \*\*\* company who *creates* Java ("Oracle America, Inc."); so it's
    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* pretty safe to run. When you are ready, click the
    "**Run**" \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\* the warning.

    itself](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932050.png)

    After you allow this Java app to run, it will verify that you
    \*\*\*\* Java \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* and (provided that everything
    during the installation worked) show you a message to this effect.

    correctly.](https://myfiles.space/user_files/76607_bcc47b3bd81737d9/76607_custom_files/img161229932061.png)

The default \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* for Java is to automatically
check for updates \*\*\* install them \*\*\*\* they are available. This
helps to keep Java patched and \*\*\*\* computer safer.
